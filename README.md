# offshoot_xhn
This is a mimic of offshoot.
Offshoot is a plugin manager, and I wonder how it works when I using the serpentAI.
So I read the source code and write some notes to help me understand.
Because I am still practicing my python skill,so this file now is still a demo version of mimic,however I will finish it gradually.Maybe do something new.
